# sfctools - A toolbox for stock-flow consistent, agent-based models

Sfctools is a lightweight and easy-to-use Python framework for agent-based macroeconomic, stock-flow consistent (ABM-SFC) modeling. It concentrates on agents in economics and helps you to construct agents, helps you to manage and document your model parameters, assures stock-flow consistency, and facilitates basic economic data structures (such as the balance sheet).
