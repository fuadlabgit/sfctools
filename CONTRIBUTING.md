Project Description
----------------------

Sfctools is a lightweight and easy-to-use Python framework for agent-based macroeconomic, stock-flow consistent (ABM-SFC) modeling. Unlike more generic frameworks like mesa, it concentrates on agents in economics. It helps you to construct agents, helps you to manage and document your model parameters, assures stock-flow consistency, and facilitates basic economic data structures (such as the balance sheet).
